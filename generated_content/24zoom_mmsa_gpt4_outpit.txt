Timestamp	What discipline did this test cover?	Which task did this test cover?	Who performed the task?	What did your group conclude about the results of this specific test?
2/26/2024 16:38:53	Writing	4. Brainstorm projects	A chatbot	ChatGPT4 developed several pretty inventive physical projects for a special education English class to complete, including the creation of a quilt, the development of a board game, and an exercise involving writing down - and sharing - story ideas that are dispersed throughout a group.
2/26/2024 16:42:28	Science	2. Identify learning tools	A chatbot	ChatGPT came up with many more ideas than we could come up with individually.
2/26/2024 16:43:30	Miscellaneous	10. List position qualifications	A person	We brainstormed between the two of us and our job description ideas were limited to the experience the two of us had to create a list and wordsmith the bullet points.
2/26/2024 16:44:52	Miscellaneous	10. List position qualifications	A chatbot	We were able to compile a Google Doc with our four different versions. We used Magic School's Chatbot (Raina), Claude, Gemini, and ChatGPT.  From those four outputs, we were able to pick elements of each that we liked.  It also created a nice format for us to create our final document.
2/26/2024 16:45:15	Computer Science	2. Identify learning tools	A person	The teacher version was better. Used Gemini. The flow chart was created for the engineering process. The teacher's loop was clearer and more meaningful.
2/26/2024 16:47:23	Computer Science	1. Write a rubric	A chatbot	Limitations were based on the limitations of the prompt. Helped me determine what I forgot to add to the prompt. Good starting point. Do not use the first version. Use it as a way to get started.
2/26/2024 16:49:31	Engineering	5. Brainstorm lesson introductions	A chatbot	Good ideas for more interesting and hands-on ideas to get students involved that I would not have thought of.

Analyzing the feedback data reveals some interesting insights into the performance of AI (specifically ChatGPT and other chatbots) versus humans across various educational tasks and disciplines. Here's a summary of the findings, highlighting common themes and notable observations for each category:
AI Performance

    Creativity and Idea Generation: AI, notably ChatGPT, excelled in generating creative ideas for projects in Writing and Engineering, providing inventive suggestions for physical projects and engaging lesson introductions that were appreciated for their novelty and practicality. This suggests AI's strength lies in its ability to draw from a vast dataset to offer diverse ideas.
    Resource Identification: In the Science discipline, ChatGPT was noted for coming up with many more learning tool ideas than the human participants could, indicating its effectiveness in aggregating and suggesting resources quickly.
    Assistance in Document Preparation: For the task of listing position qualifications in a Miscellaneous discipline, using multiple chatbots (including ChatGPT) helped compile a comprehensive and well-formatted document. This collaborative use of AI tools highlights their utility in enhancing document creation processes.

Human Performance

    Specialized Knowledge Application: In Computer Science, the human-generated version of identifying learning tools was preferred for its clarity and meaningfulness, particularly in creating a flow chart for the engineering process. This points to the value of human expertise and contextual understanding in certain specialized tasks.
    Experience and Personalization: Humans brainstorming position qualifications brought limited ideas, constrained by personal experience. However, this personal touch can sometimes lead to more tailored and nuanced outputs, despite the narrower scope of ideas compared to AI's broader, albeit sometimes generic, suggestions.

Comparative Insights

    Starting Points and Iteration: Both in Writing a rubric for Computer Science and brainstorming projects, AI's output was valued as a good starting point that could be refined through human intervention. This iterative process, where AI provides a base that humans can build upon, highlights a synergistic potential between AI and human efforts.
    Quality and Depth of Content: The feedback indicates a trade-off between the breadth of ideas AI can generate and the depth or specificity that humans can achieve through their nuanced understanding and experience in a field.

Surprising Observations

    The effectiveness of using multiple AI tools to enhance the quality of output for administrative tasks, such as drafting job descriptions, was notable. This collaborative approach between different AI models can leverage the strengths of each to produce a more refined product.
    The importance of the prompt provided to AI in determining the quality of the output, as noted in the task of writing a rubric, underscores the need for careful prompt design to maximize AI's utility.

Conclusion

The feedback suggests that AI, particularly generative models like ChatGPT, holds significant potential in educational settings, especially for generating ideas, providing diverse perspectives, and aiding in the creation of instructional and administrative documents. However, human expertise remains irreplaceable for tasks requiring deep understanding, nuanced judgment, and personalization. A collaborative approach, leveraging AI for its strengths and humans for their critical thinking and contextual expertise, appears to be the most effective strategy.

Now, acting as a data visualization specialist, imagine a chart that might be helpful in visualizing one or more of these findings. Create a double bar chart whose x-axis lists the qualities highlighted by subject participants, including but not limited to efficiency, speed, nuance, personalization, or adaptability. Then on the y-axis, rate how often those qualities were associated with the AI and human task performers. 
The order of qualities on the x-axis should be from where humans show the greatest advantage to where AI shows the greatest advantage. For example, at far left the bar for human performance might be much higher than the bar for AI performance, and at far right the disparity between bar heights would be reversed.
