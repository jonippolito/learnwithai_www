This is the web interface for a portal on AI + Pedagogy that draws data from a publicly accessible Google Sheet. I will check Github periodically for pull requests but to contribute a resource it is better to contact me directly for a separate form.

Apart from the toolkit itself, this repo also tracks revisions in a separate page that attempts to distill research on the energy and water usage of generative AI to simple takeaways for students.
