This is the web interface for a portal on AI + Pedagogy that draws data from a publicly accessible Google Sheet. Contact me if you'd like to contribute.

Apart from the toolkit itself, this repo also tracks revisions in a separate page that attempts to distill research on the energy and water usage of generative AI to simple takeaways for students.
